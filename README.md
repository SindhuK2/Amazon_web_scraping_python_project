# Amazon web scraping using Python
I have developed a Python script to perform web scraping on Amazon using the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. This script is designed to extract product data, such as names and prices, from Amazon search result pages. The process involves setting up HTTP headers to mimic a real browser, sending a GET request to a specified Amazon URL, and then parsing the HTML content to retrieve the desired information. The data extracted can be used for various purposes, including price tracking, availability monitoring, and further data analysis.

## Purpose
The script is created to scrape product details from Amazon, focusing on retrieving essential information like product names and prices.

## Libraries Used
BeautifulSoup: For parsing and navigating the HTML content.
requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch the webpage content.
pandas: (If applicable) For organizing and analyzing the extracted data.

## Steps to perform web scraping
Defined the URL for an Amazon search query.
Configured HTTP headers to simulate a request from a web browser.
Sent an HTTP GET request to the specified URL to obtain the webpage content.
Utilized BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract relevant data points, such as product names and their corresponding prices.

## Use Cases
This script can be used for automating the process of price tracking, monitoring product availability, or conducting further analysis on product trends and comparisons.
